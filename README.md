# Machine-Learning---Personal-Projects
In this repository, you will find how I have implemented applications of Machine Learning concepts, to create predictive models related to specific datasets. I worked on Google Colab notebooks and I selected the datasets from Kaggle (trending datasets). I like to visualize the application of two or more algorithms to the same project, in order to compare results and choose the best model in each case.
